#5 Exercice 3 : Mood Board
#3 By Sarah Hontoy-Major and Arman Faruqui
For Sabine Rosenberg, CART 351
Moodboard is a speculative interactive board where users are prompted to enter values through color picker and sliders(range) about their current
feelings, which are used to create a new glowing shape with a unique pulsation rate (anxiety value), size (confidence value), and hue (general mood).
Given that it would be the newest addition to the data base, the entry would be drawn last and be more visible to the user, despite the randomness of
the object's position on the screen. The color can make it more obvious to the user which shape corresponds with the form they just filled, whereas
the behavior of their object (in relation and contrast to the ones around it) can prompt reflection about the other values entered on the form.
